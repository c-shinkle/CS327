Christian Shinkle's ReadMe for Assignment 1.02

This is an implementation of a dungeon creator. It is used to create an outline, made of '-' and '|', six rooms, made of '.', and corridors, made of '#'.
The program starts by making a 80x24 array filled with blank spaces. Next, it creates an outline using two simple loops. 
Then, it generates six rooms. These rooms can vary from 4x3 to 6x5. They are randomly placed thoughout the dungeon,
such that no two rooms intersect one another. A collides function was implemented to check for collision. Next, the corridors
are drawn and, lastly, the entire dungeon is drawn using the printf function.

New features added are the save and load functions. By calling "--load" on the command line, the program can load a file and display it by parsing information from a binary file.
The file is read by using "fopen()" function and parsing the information accordingly. It can also call save a file that has either been loaded in or randomly generated.
The file is written by using "fwrite()" function and by writing the information based off of information from the "hardness" and "all_rooms" arrays.

Credit to Yuxiang Zhang for code ussed to implement drawing of the corridors.
